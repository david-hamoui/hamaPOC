# hamaPOC
Hama is a project I worked on 10th and 11th grade. It was an idea to track restaurants' waiting time so that people that are interested in going to that restaurant knows the amount of waiting time.

This proof of concept is to illustrate how the app would work. There are 3 main pages: login (login, sign in), home, profile, and restaurants.

New users (on sign in page) are remembered by the "usernamesAndPasswords.txt" and even after closing the script, you can re-login with the previously-created username and password.
